# Computational Neuroscience Crash Course 2021 (beginners)

Given the increasing complexity of neural data and the generalized use
of theoretical models in neuroscience, more and more neuroscientists
rely on computationnal tools for modelling or data analysis. We would
like to offer the possibility to those who feel that their maths /
informatics background is a bit short to update their maths and to get
familiar with basic techniques for data analysis/modelling using the
Python language. The Computational Neuroscience Crash Course (CNCC)
will span over two years, with a first part focusing on the maths and
programming pre-requisites, and a second part next year
on data analysis (and possibly modelling to follow).  

For all courses (maths and programming), we'll provide some
theoretical background, propose small exercises for participant to
work on their own and then solve the exercises together and make sure
everybody has acquired the related concepts and techniques. Courses
will be taught in English.

## Schedule

This year and due to the pandemic, the whole course will be online.
To avoid very long presentations over Zoom, **you'll have to read the material in advance**. The different topics will be briefly revised during the course. Please have a look at the [schedule](figures/Schedule.png).

**What to prepare before each day:**

## The (mini) project

The goal of the project is to sort (automatically) audio files that
correspond to the recording of adult or juvenile songbirds. If you
listen to the audio files, you will hear that the sound is quite
different between an adult (song) and a juvenile (babbling). This
means we can probably process the audio files in order to decide if it
corresponds to an adult or a juvenile and the goal is thus to write a
function `songsort(directory)` that will automatically sort
all the files present in some-path and label them accordingly.  

For the project, you'll need to team with someone else such as to work
together at one computer ([pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)). When
one is typing, the other is reading an commenting and for maximum
efficiency, you'll have to switch roles frequently. This can be done
online by sharing the screen of someone.  

For the project, we'll use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and the 
[provided notebook](project/project-2021.ipynb), which you will 
complete during the duration of the course.

## Mathematics

### [Linear Algebra](lessons/math/01-linear-algebra-arthur.pdf)

<img src="figures/indent.png" align="left"/>

In this part of the course we will introduce vectors and matrices, how to peform 
operations (such as addition & multiplication) on these objects, the correspondence 
with geometry and we will learn to solve a system of linear equations. All the above
will be accompanied by an introduction to Linear Algebra using Python.

**Prerequisites**: None  
**On-line courses**:

We highly recommend you start your study on linear algebra by watching the 
[Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
videos by 3Blue1Brown on YouTube. Emphasis should be placed on chapters 1-11, as these
chapters cover all the material you will need to complete this course. Feel free
to watch the other videos though, as they are highly interesting!

**Exercises**:

<br/>

### [Signal Processing](lessons/math/Discrete_Time_Signals_and_HW.pdf)

<img src="figures/indent.png" align="left"/>

We will start by introducing a few basic signals, all in discrete time. We will show
examples using Python and go over the Fourier Transform, which is ubiquituous in
signal processing. Next, we will introduce spectral analysis and learn how to compute
the correlation of signals in order to reveal similarities between them.
All this material will be covered in the course of two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).

**Prerequisites**: None  
**On-line courses**:

You should start by reviewing the following:

1. What is signal processing, and why do we care? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmSvQe2FDKs

4. [Wikipedia | Autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) and [Wikipedia | Cross-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation): (in both pages, focus on the case of ‘deterministic signals’ and ignore the case of random vectors).

## Programming lessons

### [Installation](lessons/programming/01-installation.md)

<img src="figures/indent.png" align="left"/>

This lesson aims at providing the student with a clean development environment,
including Python installation and essential packages, a decent text editor, and
a shell. We'll also introduce the Python & IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook
and explains how to run a python script from the command line.
In case you cannot install Python/Anaconda in your computer, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bordeaux-neurocampus/CNCC-2021-beginner/blob/main/project/introduction.ipynb). Further information on how to use Colab with our data will be given during the course.

### [Introduction](lessons/programming/02-introduction.md)

<img src="figures/indent.png" align="left"/>

We introduce here Python, a powerful and easy to learn programming language. It
has *efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach
to object-oriented programming* (Python website). However, we'll only
cover the strict minimum necessary for getting started with numerical computing.

**Prerequisites**: [Installation](#installation)  
**See also**: [Official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/tutorial), [Dive into Python](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/),

### [Numerical computing](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html)

<img src="figures/indent.png" align="left"/>

This lesson gives an overview of NumPy, the core library for performant
numerical computing, with support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and
matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to
operate on these arrays.

**Prerequisites**: [Introduction](#introduction)  
**See also**: [Scipy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/), 
[Numpy for Matlab users](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html),

<br/>

### [Data Visualization](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)

<img src="figures/indent.png" align="left"/>

We'll explore the matplotlib library which is a Python 2D plotting library
which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and
interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python
scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application
servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

**Prerequisites**: [Numerical computing](#numerical-computing)  
**See also**: [Matplotlib tutorial](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial),

<br/>

### [Scientific computing](http://scipy-lectures.org/intro/scipy.html)

<img src="figures/indent.png" align="left"/>

This lesson, from the scipy mlecture notes, will cover scipy which is a
scientific-computing libraries, such as the GSL (GNU Scientific Library for C
and C++), or Matlab’s toolboxes. Scipy is the core package for scientific
routines in Python; it is meant to operate efficiently on numpy arrays, so that
numpy and scipy work hand in hand.
